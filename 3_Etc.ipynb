    "# More to learn üìö\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the core parts of the data science stack in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas` (with the help of `sqlalchemy`, `requests`, or basic Python) to import and explore your data\n",
    "- `matplotlib` to visualize your data\n",
    "- `numpy`, `statsmodels` and/or `scikit-learn` to use some statistics or machine learning on your data\n",
    "\n",
    "But then there's everything else! We won't have time for this, but there are a lot of other parts of the data stack - more \"meta\" parts. Knowing more about these makes you a stronger contributor and makes things, overall, more easy for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra power tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main tools we've been using all during this tutorial - and haven't mentioned once! - is [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)!\n",
    "\n",
    "![jupyter logo](imgs/jupyter_logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This thing here - what we're typing in and running - is a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter grew out of [IPython](https://ipython.org/), which was an interactive way to mix code with Markdown (simplified HTML) for easy-to-read and easy-to-share notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are where a lot of data science happens - especially the exploratory, visualization stuff. Right now, I'm using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to host these Jupyter notebooks online - and to have them be _interactive_! (That is, you can modify the code, run it, and see what happens!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Jupyter is pretty straightforward. You just need to install it (e.g. `pip install jupyter`), launch it with `jupyter notebook` and then navigate - using your favorite web browser - to your `localhost`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, code tutorials and workshops can get really painful because of _installation_. Everyone has a slightly different system, with a slightly different Python ecosystem on their machine, and so things can get messy and painful when trying to, say, get everyone to lauch their first Jupyter notebook on their machine! \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this problem, people often use **virtual environments**. Virtual environments are ways to keep a siloed, walled-off version of Python (and any packages you want to `pip` install) on your machine. You keep it distinct from your system Python (if you're using a Mac, for example, you have Python 2.7 installed already) and you keep your libraries from getting messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways to make a virtual environment, and I highly recommend [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) combined with its add-on, [`pyenv virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv). For example, for these workshop materials, I wanted to keep things clean and only include the bare minimum packages I would need to have everything run. To do that I did:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "angela@home $ cd path/to/these/materials\n",
    "angela@home $ pyenv virtualenv pyladies\n",
    "angela@home $ pyenv local pyladies\n",
    "angela@home $ pip install jupyter pandas numpy scipy statsmodels scikit-learn matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically:\n",
    "1. `pyenv virtualenv pyladies` $\\rightarrow$ Created a `pyenv` virtual environment called `pyladies`.\n",
    "2. `pyenv local pyladies` $\\rightarrow$ Created a secret `.python-version` file, which tells `pyenv` to always use the `pyladies` virtual environment when I'm in this folder.\n",
    "3. `pip install [blah blah]` $\\rightarrow$ In this brand new Python environment I've made, install all the packages I'll need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL and databases\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is its own beast, with its own syntax and all that. You can do a _lot_ of data exploration - and even some descriptive statistics - in SQL. I really recommend [Udacity's free course on relational databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197) to start your SQL journey.\n",
