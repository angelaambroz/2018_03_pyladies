    "\n",
    "These days, data shows up in a variety of formats:\n",
    "- Files on disk (e.g. `some_data.csv`, `my_excel_stuff.xlsx`, `some_nested_stuff.json`, `some_picture.png`)\n",
    "- Structured data in \"the cloud\" (an API, such as [The New York Times's](https://developer.nytimes.com/))\n",
    "- Databases (SQL and NoSQL)\n",
    "- Streaming (Apache Kafka)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order of frequency, the most common sources of data for me have been:\n",
    "- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Vertica)\n",
    "- `.csv` files\n",

    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), developed by Wes McKinney in the late 2000s, is the Swiss Army knife of data science in Python. With pandas, you can:\n",
    "- Import data from (almost) any source (files I/O, APIs, SQL databases, HTML tables).\n",
    "- You can convert typical Python data structures (e.g. `dict`, `list`) into the pandas-native \"dataframe\" format.\n",
    "- You can visualize data.\n",
    "- You can do create/calculate/drop columns, take means and standard deviations, and generally do data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use pandas to grab data from some different formats!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pandas defines **dataframes** as 2-dimensional arrays of data, i.e. a tabular data format.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Importing data into pandas (always) follows the same pattern: `pd.read_*(file_source)`. For example, `pd.read_csv('some_csv.csv')`, `pd.read_sql('select * from some_table', sql_connection_object)`\n",
