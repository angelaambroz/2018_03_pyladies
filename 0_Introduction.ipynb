    "# Step 1: Getting data\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, data shows up in a variety of formats:\n",
    "- Files on disk (e.g. `some_data.csv`, `my_excel_stuff.xlsx`, `some_nested_stuff.json`, `some_picture.png`)\n",
    "- Structured data in \"the cloud\" (an API, such as [The New York Times's](https://developer.nytimes.com/))\n",
    "- Databases (e.g. SQL and NoSQL)\n",
    "- Streaming (e.g. Apache Kafka)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order of frequency, the most common sources of data for me have been:\n",
    "- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Vertica)\n",
    "- `.csv` files\n",

    "[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/), developed by Wes McKinney in the late 2000s, is the Swiss Army knife of data science in Python. With `pandas`, you can:\n",
    "- Import data from (almost) any source (files, APIs, databases, tables on websites).\n",
    "- Convert typical Python data structures (e.g. `dict`, `list`) into `pandas` dataframes.\n",
    "- Visualize data.\n",
    "- Create/calculate/drop columns, take means and standard deviations, and generally clean and explore your data!\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Pro tip**\n",
    "\n",
    "> `pandas` defines **dataframes** as 2-dimensional arrays of data, i.e. a tabular data format. This is similar to `R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Importing data into pandas (always) follows the same pattern: `pd.read_*(file_source)`. For example, `pd.read_csv('some_csv.csv')`, `pd.read_sql('select * from some_table', sql_connection_object)`\n",

    "### Third tool: APIs and `requests` and Star Wars, oh my\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to grab data from the, _ahem_, \"cloud\". That is, the data isn't hosted on a database that you have access to, nor is it on any files that you can download. Nowadays, many organizations offer their data via an API. But what is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is an [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface). It's a structured way to share data across the web. Many websites will have (1) a user-facing front end and (2) an API. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) and [The New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/)\n",
    "- [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/) and the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/).\n",
    "- [and many more!](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every API is a bit different. Meaning: read their docs! Some APIs are better documented than others. But the basic process is always the same: You access the data in an API by making an **HTTP request** to a specific **endpoint** (i.e. a URL). That endpoint normally sends the data back in `.json` format (though it might send it back as an `.xml`, or something else!).  Often you'll need to register your intent to use an API, and you'll be given an **API key** - this is a way for the API maintainers to \"rate limit\" users. That is, to prevent users from bombarding their API with millions of requests per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since grabbing data from an API necessitates (1) talking over HTTP and (2) dealing with the `json` data format, we'll need a couple more tools: the `json` library (which comes with the Python standard library) and [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) (which you need to install on your machine with `pip install requests`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a simple API - one that doesn't require an API key: the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First, we use the `requests` library to issue an HTTP `GET` request from the Star Wars API's `people` endpoint"
